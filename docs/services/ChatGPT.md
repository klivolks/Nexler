# ChatGPT User Documentation

## Overview

ChatGPT is a text generation and code generation tool. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate text and code based on provided instructions.

## Setup

Before you can use ChatGPT, you need to set up OpenAI's API key in the `.env` file. This API key is used to make requests to the OpenAI API.

## Classes and Methods

ChatGPT provides several methods:

- `create`: This method generates text based on the `instruction` provided. The text is generated using OpenAI's "text-davinci-003" engine.

- `code`: This method reads code from a file, sends it to OpenAI's "code-davinci-edit-001" engine for editing, and saves the edited code in a new file. The editing is guided by the `instruction` provided.

- `edit`: This method reads text from a file, sends it to OpenAI's "text-davinci-edit-001" engine for editing, and saves the edited data in a new file. The editing is guided by the `instruction` provided.

- `insert`: This method reads code from a file, inserts generated code into a specified location (marked by '[insert]'), and saves the new code in a new file. The code to be inserted is generated using OpenAI's "text-davinci-003" engine.

Each of these methods takes an `instruction` argument that guides the text or code generation. The `instruction` should be set before calling the method.

## Usage

First, initialize a `ChatGPT` instance:

```python
gpt = ChatGPT()
```

Set the `instruction` and the `file` properties as needed:

```python
gpt.instruction = "list required sections of a business proposal"
gpt.file = 'app/components/HelloWorld/__init___2.py'
```

Call the appropriate method for your task:

```python
# To generate text
response = gpt.create()

# To edit code
response = gpt.code()

# To insert generated code into existing code
response = gpt.insert()
```

Print the response to see the generated text or the number of tokens used:

```python
print(response)
```

Please note that the `create` method returns generated text, while the `code` and `insert` methods return the number of tokens used by the OpenAI API.

## Considerations

The generated text or code might not always be perfect, as it's generated by an AI model that's not perfect. Always review and test the generated text or code before using it in a real-world scenario.
