# `error_util.py` User Documentation

`error_util.py` module provides utility functions to handle various types of exceptions and return appropriate HTTP response codes and messages. This module is part of the `nexler.utils` package.

## Functions

The main functions defined in this module are various exception handlers, which are registered to handle specific types of exceptions. Each exception handler takes an exception as input, formats an appropriate error message, and returns an HTTP response with an appropriate status code and the error message.

### handle_http_exception

This function handles `HTTPException` type exceptions. It maps different types of HTTP exceptions to appropriate response utility methods from `response_util`, and returns the result of calling the appropriate method with an error message based on the exception.

### Other Exception Handlers

There are other functions in this module which handle specific types of exceptions, including:

- `handle_bad_request`
- `handle_unauthorized`
- `handle_forbidden`
- `handle_not_found`
- `handle_method_not_allowed`
- `handle_conflict`
- `handle_unsupported_media_type`
- `handle_server_error`
- `handle_not_implemented`
- `handle_key_error`
- `handle_value_error`
- `handle_type_error`
- `handle_index_error`
- `handle_attribute_error`
- `handle_zero_division_error`

These functions handle their respective exceptions, and return an HTTP response with an appropriate status code and an error message based on the exception.

### register_error_handlers

This function registers the exception handlers to an `app` object. This should be called during the initialization of the application, passing the Flask application instance as argument.

## Usage

Typically, you would use these utility functions to register error handlers to your Flask application during its initialization. Here is an example:

```python
from nexler.utils.error_util import register_error_handlers

# Assume 'app' is your Flask application instance
register_error_handlers(app)
```

In this example, `register_error_handlers` function is used to register all the exception handlers to the Flask application `app`. After this, when any registered exception occurs during the execution of your application, the corresponding handler function will be called to handle the exception and return an appropriate HTTP response.
